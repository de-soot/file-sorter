# File Sorter
A simple Python script that cleans up messy files and organises them into sorted folders based on their file extensions.

## Requirements
`python3` (>=3.0.0)

## Usage
[Download](https://github.com/de-soot/file-sorter/releases/latest) and run `main.py` in the directory that you want to clean up. For example:
```sh
cd ~/Desktop
python3 main.py
```

### Note
You can change the default folder destination directories to wherever you want your files to go and add more file extensions not included in the source code.
