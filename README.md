# File Sorter
A simple Python script that cleans up messy files and organises them into sorted folders based on their file extensions.

## Usage
Download and run `main.py` in the directory that you want to clean up.

### Note
You can change the default folder destination directories in the program and add more file extensions not included in the program using a text editor.
Feel free to contribute more file extensions by opening pull requests.
